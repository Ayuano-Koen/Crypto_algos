## Introduction

In today's digital world, ensuring the security and privacy of data is paramount. Cryptography provides the tools necessary to achieve this, allowing for secure communication and data transmission over insecure channels. The Crypto_algos repository aims to demystify cryptography by providing clear and concise implementations of two fundamental cryptographic algorithms.

## Features

- **ElGamal Cryptosystem**: Encrypt and decrypt messages using the ElGamal Cryptosystem. This asymmetric encryption algorithm relies on the properties of finite fields and the discrete logarithm problem for its security.

- **RSA Algorithm**: Harness the power of RSA encryption and decryption. This widely-used asymmetric encryption algorithm is based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers, ensuring secure data transmission.

## Usage

To use the cryptographic functionalities provided by this repository, simply run the Python scripts included. Follow the prompts to input messages for encryption and decryption.

```bash
python3 elgamal.py
python3 rsa.py
```

## Example:
- **ElGamal Cryptosystem**<br>
 Generate ElGamal keys and encrypt a message<br>
 Enter the message: Hello, World!

- **RSA Algorithm**<br>
Generate RSA keys and encrypt a message<br>
Enter the message: OpenAI is amazing!<br>

## Requirements:

- **Python 3.x**

 - **Standard Python libraries: random, math**
